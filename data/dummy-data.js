      "Upgrade your cookware and bakeware essentials with the all-encompassing Stackable Dutch Oven, Braiser, and Grill Pan Set from Staub. Crafted in France from Staub's signature enameled cast iron, this set features a beautiful Dark Blue and textured black matte enamel interior that does not require seasoning, unlike traditional cast iron. This design allows for exceptional heat retention and distribution and is nearly nonstick for easy food release. The defining feature of this set is its innovative, space-saving design; gently sloped sides allow for secure nesting, taking up minimal storage space in your cabinets or on your shelves. Included are attachable rubberized bumpers that help prevent any chips or scratches when storing. With this set of three dishes, you can bake pastas and casseroles, simmer hearty soups, grill fish, braise chicken, and more — these pieces can be used on all stovetops (including induction), in the oven up to 500°F, in the microwave, and in the fridge or freezer. Though dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended to preserve the quality and longevity of the enamel. ",
